# Distributed Construction of Minimal Models and Minimum Model
**This research project is advised and guided by Prof. Rachel Ben Eliyahu Zohary.**

This project is about developing a distributed algorithm for a construction of minimum models and a minimum model.

The tasks of finding minimal models and minimum model is central in Artificial Intelligence (AI). These computational tasks are at the heart of several knowledge representation systems, including circumscription, default logic, minimal diagnosis, planning, multi-agents coordinationand, and logic programs under stable model semantics.
Yet, it turns out that this task is formidable even when very simple theories are considered. It is, therefore, crucial to be able to break this task into several sub-tasks that can be solved separately and in parallel.
